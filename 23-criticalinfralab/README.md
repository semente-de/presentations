Setting the environment for semente: Soil, Handling, Time, Fruits

1. SOIL
- Projects in Brazil (2002 - 2022)

    - a forest of initiatives: an environment, where no individual specimem is as strong as the community. Things die and then become soil for other things. The soil is not necessarily fertile for the material composition of its earth. Ongoing dynamics that happens on top of the soil are important and often complement a weaker soil. Building on the work of John Thackara, author of "How to thrive in the next economy". He gave a talk titled "[Thinking like a forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDd7J-CLlxg)". A forest is an ever changing community, unlike a single plant por with chili on your kitchen.

2. HANDLING Beyond everyday praxis and maintenance, you have to aware of the bad weather and changes in the environment
- changing conditions - observe and adapt
In the case of the Brazilian digital context:

    - (political coup that installed interim conservative politicians in 2015)

    - technologies being used to distort political representation processes - hyper-targeting, weaponization of messaging, deep fakes (as much in Brazil as everywhere else - Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, Trump, Bannon, Bolsonaro).

    - far-right turn in municipalities (2016) and federal government (2018) with support by financial powers

    - COVID pandemic


3. TIME
- how to regenerate a forest:

    - understand the current environment

    - identify potentialities

    - create conditions for growth, even if in different formats. Start a forest planting Ingá, not the best option for wood or food, but it's a first layer of shadow, protection and nutrients that will rot and feed next generations of life.

    - recurrent and cyclical, but not circular. spiral of time

- diagnose and memory

    - [ID21](https://fonte.wiki/id21) (digital inclusion): interview about what were the current conditions?

    - [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki): (fonte means water source): document memory of those projects.


4. FRUITS
semente (seed): how can we move forward again, beyond only surviving/defending our stake?
- existing methods for collaborative processes focus too much on starting projects from a genius individual leader with a bright, clear idea (or an opportunistic one).
- how do we regenerate from a community perspective instead of just replanting individual species?


semente: enable stakeholders to seed a project plan that can grow into decision making.
enabling decision-making over digital policy

Starting dialogues

Four key areas
- soil (infrastructure)
- handling (praxis): view of what are the actions needed for the project to grow, obstacles
- time: what need to happen over time, how to preserve memory of the project
- fruits: expected outcome, how to connect the community to the West

additional boxes on the canvas
- ethos and principles:
- dilemmas: obstacles that are not easy to overcome

from a playbook to an interchangeable deck of knowldge

identified goals
- it must map the community
- create convergence points
- invite all stakeholders to rethink the context
- identify relationships: allies

context of semente: before election 2022, ready for two scenarios. In  one, there was a chance to stop things getting worse so fast. The other was an even more extrem far-right situation. Fortunately, the latter did not pass, which doest not mean things are solved or easy.

#### interactive section
roles
- ideator: young community member and community leader
- partner-sponsors: NGO non-community roots, set on preconceived ideas of "Digital Inclusion"
- dilemmas: privacy and data security,


Our group case
- background (Global Voices' Sindhu leading Unfreedom Monitor):

    - srilanka

    - journalists killed before civil war ends

    - monitoring database used for advocacy

    what you want: prevent law from being weaponzied ; a system of


Soil: database; encryptionl verification infrastructure
Handling:
time: how to measure impact; what if funding gets cut
fruit: self-sustainable ; expand to other countries

    ethos: justice; do no harm; accuracy

    dilemma: could cause harm.


reflections:
- facilitation is very important to build a dialogue.
- non-profit org should be held accountable as well.

---------------

Building digital solutions that can help communities. Who do you call the community? There are people who are aware of the possibilities and dangers of technologies. But would you call those people the project community?

Soil

Preconditions that need to be in place for the project to start

Handling
Actions needed and obstacles for that to happen.

Time
What are the changing conditions in the world and how do you preserve the memory?

Fruit
What could be a measure of succes?

In the middle: community.

Ethos/principle
—> Views on how results are shared

Dilemma’s
—> Obstacles that are not that easy to overcome
